# GPT-4 vision playground

In the repository, I have presented simple cases where the gpt-4-vision-preview model can be used. Some of them are
tasks that came to mind shortly after the release of this model.

The analyses are not detailed; I am not processing a large amount of data – my main idea was to check the actual
capabilities of this model.

I focus on three issues which are presented in separate notebooks:

## Generating HTML skeleton based on a skeleton image

On a simple HTML sketch, I tried to obtain an HTML page code that would reflect the sketch.
`notebooks/generate_html_from_skeleton_image.ipynb`

## Answering questions to images

I checked what questions the chat is capable of answering – the results are impressive.
`notebooks/qa_for_images.ipynb`

## Data Extraction

I saw how the model manages with OCR tasks and reading data from invoices.
`notebooks/extract_data.ipynb`

# More analysis

For more analyse create an issue with task description.
